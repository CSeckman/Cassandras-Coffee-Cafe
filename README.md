# **Cassandra's Coffee Cafe**


## **Getting Started:**

One of the things in my life that will always brighten my day, no matter the mood, is a delicious coffee or chai drink! It is one of my favorite ways to spoil myself and others! 

In this application, not only can you create and collect your favorite drinks, you can also collect "journal entries" based on times you enjoyed this drink. I feel like there is something so nostalgic about certain of my favorite drinks that always bring me back to an occasion, event or scenerio.  I hope you enjoy reminiscencing about your drink memories as much as I do!
